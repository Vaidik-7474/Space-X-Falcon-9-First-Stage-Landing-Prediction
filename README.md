# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction

 • Project background and context: We are an alternative company for SpaceX, 
which is on the same market segment of the rocket industry. We want to launch 
our own commercial rocket. But we have a dilemma about the way on we have 
to do the first stage, about it could be worthy to land or not the first stage.

• Problems you want to find answers: Learning from Falcon 9 rocket launches 
data, we want to extract information about what first stage strategy is better in
terms of cost
